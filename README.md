# GYAZ-Export-Tools
Blender 'Armature object remover' for REDengine

Forked from helluvamesh's GYAZ export tools for UE4. This add-on is able to strip the armature bone from the FBX mesh. REDengine will interpret the 'Armature' object as the root bone, which can break animations (espeically mimics). Very minimal changes to work as intended for REDengine purposes.
